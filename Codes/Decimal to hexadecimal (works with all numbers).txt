Also, the reason we use 15 is because 15 is 1111 in binary and we know that num&1 will get the last bit, similarly 1111 will get the last four bits.
          finalval = hexarr[rem] + finalval;
          num = num>>>4;    //>>> is called an unsigned right shift, it does the same thing as >> but >> works differently depending on whether its -ve or +ve. Here, we use >>>4 because we want to remove the last four bits of the number. This does the same thing as num/16.
